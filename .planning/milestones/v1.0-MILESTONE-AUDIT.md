## End-to-End Flow Verification

### Flow U1: Anonymous Browsing
**Status: COMPLETE**

- Homepage loads entity overview
- Sidebar displays all entities by type
- Category detail pages show inheritance graphs
- Property/subobject pages show used-by categories
- Search returns matching entities

### Flow U2: Wiki Admin PR Creation
**Status: COMPLETE**

- POST draft to API returns capability URL
- Navigate to capability URL loads draft review page
- Diff viewer shows field-level changes grouped by type
- Module assignment works for new categories
- Profile editing with dependency feedback
- Save persists changes via PATCH
- Open PR triggers OAuth flow
- PR created in GitHub with structured summary

**Human verified:** PR created at https://github.com/labki-org/labki-schemas/pull/1

### Flow U3: Version Comparison
**Status: COMPLETE**

- Version list loads from GitHub releases
- Two-version selector works
- Field-level diffs display correctly
- Changes grouped by entity type

## Technical Debt

**None accumulated.** All phases completed without TODOs, FIXMEs, or deferred items.

## Conclusion

Ontology Hub v1 is complete and ready for release. The core value proposition is achieved:
