# Ontology Hub

## What This Is

A public platform for browsing, validating, and proposing changes to a shared Labki ontology maintained in GitHub. The platform provides a unified interface where the same UI and query logic serves both canonical browsing and draft editing—draft mode overlays deltas on canonical data. Wiki admins can create drafts from the Hub UI or push from MediaWiki, validate changes, and submit GitHub PRs. GitHub OAuth is only required at PR submission time.

## Core Value

Enable wiki admins to go from local schema edit to GitHub PR in under 5 minutes, with zero platform accounts and strong validation feedback.

## Current Milestone: v2.0 (Platform Rebuild)

**Goal:** Full database/API/frontend rebuild with canonical data, relationship tables, draft-as-deltas, and graph visualization.

**Target features:**
- Latest-only canonical storage (Ontology Hub retains only current version; labki-schemas repo is the version archive)
- Webhook-triggered ingest from labki-schemas on push
- Precomputed relationship tables (inheritance, property membership, where-used)
- Draft model storing deltas (JSON Patch for updates, full replacement for creates)
- Auto-rebase for in-progress drafts when new canonical is ingested
- Graph-based navigation with module grouping hulls
- Template entity support (new entity type)
- Unified browse/draft UI with same underlying query logic

## v1.0 Summary

**Shipped:** 2026-01-23
**Codebase:** 15,392 LOC (8,355 Python + 7,037 TypeScript)
**Stack:** FastAPI 0.115, React 19, Vite 7, PostgreSQL 17, Docker Compose
**Human verified:** https://github.com/labki-org/labki-schemas/pull/1

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Public browsing of entities (categories, properties, subobjects) with search and inheritance graphs — v1.0
- ✓ Module and profile browsing with dependency/overlap information — v1.0
- ✓ Version browsing with diff views between releases — v1.0

- ✓ Capability-URL protected drafts with TTL expiration — v1.0
- ✓ Draft review UI with field-level diffs and validation feedback — v1.0
- ✓ Compatibility classification (major/minor/patch) per change — v1.0
- ✓ Module assignment for new entities in draft — v1.0
- ✓ GitHub OAuth triggered only at PR creation time — v1.0
- ✓ PR creation via GitHub API (branch, commit, PR with structured summary) — v1.0
- ✓ Module/profile creation and editing within drafts — v1.0
- ✓ Validation engine: consistency checks, breaking change detection, semver suggestions — v1.0

### Active

(Defined in REQUIREMENTS.md for v2.0)

### Out of Scope

- Platform-native user accounts or saved workspaces — GitHub is the only identity provider, used only at PR time
- Social features (comments, likes, reputation) — not a community platform
- Hosting non-schema wiki content (dashboards, query pages) — separate future registry
- Runtime source-of-truth for schema deployment — GitHub remains authoritative
- Mobile-optimized UI — desktop-first for v1
- "Canonical vs local overlay" toggle — deferred to v2 based on user feedback
- Release artifact indexing for SemanticSchemas consumption — deferred to v2

## Context

**Domain**: SemanticSchemas is a MediaWiki extension that auto-generates Forms and Templates from schema definitions. The extension exists at `/dev/SemanticSchemas` but currently lacks import/export. This platform becomes the canonical schema hub; the extension will be updated to export drafts here.

**Entity types (6 total)**:
- **Category**: Entity types with inheritance (parents), required/optional properties and subobjects
- **Property**: Attributes with datatypes, cardinality, validation rules, parent hierarchy
- **Subobject**: Reusable nested structures with their own properties
- **Module**: Logical groupings of categories/properties/subobjects/templates with dependencies
- **Bundle**: Curated collections of modules for deployment scenarios (renamed from Profile)
- **Template**: Wikitext rendering templates for properties

**Canonical repo format** (labki-schemas):
- `categories/*.json` — entity types with JSON Schema validation
- `properties/*.json` — attributes with `Has_*`/`Is_*` naming convention
- `subobjects/*.json` — nested structures
- `modules/{name}/module.json` — entity list + current version number
- `modules/{name}/versions/*.tar.gz` — versioned entity snapshots (generated by GitHub Actions)
- `bundles/{name}/bundle.json` — module list + current version number
- `bundles/{name}/versions/*.tar.gz` — versioned module snapshots (generated by GitHub Actions)
- `templates/**/*.json` — wikitext rendering definitions
- `*/_schema.json` — JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validation per directory

**Entity key format**: Path-derived from directory + filename (e.g., `categories/Person`, `properties/Has_email`)

**Users**:
- **U1 (Anonymous browser)**: Explore ontology via graph or list, view diffs between versions
- **U2 (Wiki admin)**: Create/edit drafts in Hub UI or push from MediaWiki, validate, submit PR
- **U3 (Maintainer)**: Review PRs with structured summaries and validation output

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: FastAPI (Python) backend, Vite + React frontend — matches existing expertise
- **Infrastructure**: Docker image for local dev/testing; VPS deployment with Caddy reverse proxy for HTTPS
- **Database**: Postgres for drafts and indexing
- **Domain**: ontology.labki.org
- **Auth model**: No platform accounts; GitHub OAuth only at PR-time
- **Draft security**: Capability URLs only; tokens never logged, stored as hashes; 7-day TTL default
- **Rate limiting**: Per-IP limits on draft creation; payload caps (1-5MB)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Split schema by entity type in repo | Cleaner diffs, easier partial updates, natural module boundaries | ✓ Good |
| FastAPI + Vite React | Team familiarity, good async support, fast frontend builds | ✓ Good |
| Capability URLs for drafts | No accounts needed, simple sharing, secure with proper token handling | ✓ Good |
| GitHub OAuth at PR-time only | Minimize friction; most users just browse or review | ✓ Good |
| Postgres over SQLite | Better for concurrent access, easier to scale, proper indexing | ✓ Good |
| Fragment-based capability URLs | Fragments not sent in HTTP Referrer, reduces token leakage | ✓ Good |
| SHA-256 token hashing | Never store plaintext tokens, 64-char hex in database | ✓ Good |
| Zustand with immer | Immutable state updates with readable mutable-style syntax | ✓ Good |
| graphlib.TopologicalSorter | Stdlib cycle detection with CycleError providing cycle path | ✓ Good |
| Git Data API for PR creation | Atomic multi-file commits with user's OAuth token | ✓ Good |
| Breaking changes as warnings | Valid changes that are impactful, not errors to block on | ✓ Good |
| SessionMiddleware for OAuth | Required for session-based state during OAuth flow | ✓ Good |
| Path-derived entity keys | Maps cleanly to repo file paths, survives refactors | — Pending |
| Hybrid patch format | JSON Patch for updates (granular), full replacement for creates (simpler) | — Pending |
| Materialized inheritance tables | Precompute category_property_effective at ingest for fast reads; localized re-materialization during drafts | — Pending |
| Multi-hull module overlays | Show multiple module boundaries simultaneously in graph view | — Pending |
| Full template support | Templates as first-class entities: browse, edit, draft like others | — Pending |
| Full rebuild approach | Replace v1.0 implementation completely, reuse working code where appropriate | — Pending |
| Latest-only in Ontology Hub | Only retain current version in database; repo is the version archive | — Pending |
| Webhook-triggered ingest | Repo push triggers ingest via webhook; no manual refresh needed | — Pending |
| Draft auto-rebase | When new canonical is ingested, in-progress drafts rebase automatically | — Pending |
| GitHub Actions version bumping | Actions auto-generate tarballs and bump semver (major/minor/patch) on PR merge | — Pending |
